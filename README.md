# ATM-OOP

OOP layout for ATM application

Do the Unit 3 Lab 1 assignment, but instead of the instructions in Moodle, create an object or objects to represent the ATM assignment.
Do not refactor the code or attempt to write fully functioning methods...
just work through what objects, methods and properties you might use to represent the ATM machine.
Create your own repo from scratch and submit your GitHub repo URL in Moodle.
